== Introduction


Couchbase Sync Gateway is a key component of the Couchbase Mobile stack.
It is an Internet-facing synchronization mechanism that securely syncs data across devices as well as between devices and the cloud.
Couchbase Mobile {target-version} introduces centralized persistent module configuration of synchronization, which simplifies the administration of Sync Gateway clusters -- see {sync-gateway-config-overview--xref}


The core functions of the Sync Gateway include:

* Data Synchronization across devices and the cloud
* Authorization & Access Control
* Data Validation

.What You Will Learn
****
In this tutorial you will learn how to:

* Set up a basic Couchbase Sync Gateway configuration to sync content between multiple Couchbase Lite enabled clients -- see: <<lbl-sync-gateway>>. +
We will cover the basics of the {sync-gateway-config-overview--xref}

* Configure your Sync Gateway to enforce data routing, access control and authorization -- see: <<lbl-sync-function>>. +
We will cover the basics of the {sync-function--xref}.

* Configure your Couchbase Lite clients for replication with the Sync Gateway

* Use "Live Queries" or Query events within your Couchbase Lite clients to be asynchronously notified of changes -- see: <<lbl-query-events>>

We will be using a Swift App as an example of a Couchbase Lite enabled client.


You can learn more about the Sync Gateway here in the {sync-gateway-docs--xref}.

****

== Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes familiarity with building Swift apps with Xcode, XCFrameworks and with Couchbase Lite.

* If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Couchbase Lite, it is recommended that you walk through the following tutorials

** Fundamentals of using Couchbase Lite as a standalone database -- see: {standalone--xref}.

** Using queries with a prebuilt version of Couchbase Lite database -- see: {query--xref}.

* iOS (Xcode 12/13) +
Download the latest version from the {mac-app-store--url}
+
NOTE: If you are on an older version of Xcode, which you need to retain for other development needs, make a copy of your existing version of Xcode and install the latest Xcode version.
That way you can have multiple versions of Xcode on your Mac.

* git (Optional) +
This is required if you would prefer to pull the source code from GitHub repo.
** Create a {github-account--url} if you don't already have one
** git can be downloaded from {github-download--url}

* curl HTTP client +
You can use any HTTP client of your choice.
But we will use *curl* in our tutorial.
Download the latest version from the {curl-download--url}

* Docker +
We will be using Docker to run images of both Couchbase Server and the Sync Gateway -- to download Docker, or for more information, see: {docker-download--url}


== System Overview


We will be working with the simple "User Profile" app which we introduced in the {standalone--xref} and extended in the {query--xref}.

In this tutorial, we will be extending that app to support data sync.
It will do the following

* Allows users to log in and create or update their user profile information.
The user profile view is _automatically updated_ every time the profile information changes in the underlying database
* The user profile information is synced with a remote Sync Gateway which then syncs it to other devices (subject to access control and routing configurations specified in the `sync function`)

image::userprofile_app_overview.gif[{alt-text}]


== App Installation

=== Fetching App Source Code
Clone the *_sync_* branch of the `User Profile Demo` project from GitHub.
Type the following command in your terminal

[source, bash,  subs="attributes+"]
----
git clone -b sync https://github.com/couchbaselabs/userprofile-couchbase-mobile.git
----

=== Installing Couchbase Lite XCFramework
Next, we will download the Couchbase Lite {target-version} XCFramework.

The Couchbase Lite iOS XCFramework is distributed via SPM, CocoaPods, Carthage or you can download the pre-built XCFramework -- see the {cbl-install--xref} documentation for more information.

In our example, we will download the pre-built version of the XCFramework, using a script.
To do this, type the following in a command terminal:

[source, bash,  subs="attributes+"]
----
cd /path/to/UserProfileDemo/content/modules/userprofile/examples

sh install_tutorial.sh 3.0.0 // <.>

----
<.> Where 3.0.0 is the required Couchbase Lite release number.

Next, let's verify the installation.

=== Try it Out
. Open the `UserProfileDemo.xcodeproj` Xcode project file, located at +
`/path/to/UserProfileDemo/content/modules/userprofile/examples`
+
[source, bash,  subs="attributes+"]
----
open UserProfileDemo.xcodeproj
----

. Use Xcode to build and run the project in **two simulators**
. Verify that you see the login screen on both the simulators

image::user_profile_login_2.png[{alt-text}]


== Data Model

If you followed along with the {query--xref}, you can skip this section and proceed to the <<Backend Installation>> section.
We have not changed the Data model for this tutorial.

Couchbase Lite is a JSON Document Store.
A Document is a logical collection of named fields and values.
The values are any valid JSON types. In addition to the standard JSON types, Couchbase Lite supports some special types like `Date` and `Blob`.
While it is not required or enforced, it is a recommended practice to include a _"type"_ property that can serve as a namespace for related.

=== The User Profile Document
The app deals with a single Document with a _"type"_ property of _"user"_ as shown in  <<ex-user-profile-doc>>.
The document ID is of the form _"user::{emailId}"_.

[#ex-user-profile-doc]
.A user profile document
[source, json]
----
{
    "type":"user",
    "name":"Jane Doe",
    "email":"jame.doe@earth.org",
    "address":"101 Main Street",
    "image":CBLBlob (image/jpg),
    "university":"Rensselaer Polytechnic"
}
----

==== The User Record

The _"user"_ Document is encoded to a native struct named _UserRecord_ as shown in <<ex-user-rec>>

[#ex-user-rec]
.The encoding of a UserRecord to a native structure
[source,{tutorial-platform}, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
include::example$UserProfileDemo/model/UserRecord.swift[indent=0, tags=userrecord]
----

=== The University Document
The app comes bundled with a collection of Documents of type _"university"_.
Each Document represents a university -- see <<ex-university-doc>>

[#ex-university-doc]
.A university document
[source, json]
----
{
    "type":"university","web_pages": [
      "http://www.rpi.edu/"
    ],
    "name": "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute",
    "alpha_two_code": "US",
    "state-province": null,
    "domains": [
      "rpi.edu"
    ],
    "country": "United States"
}
----


==== UniversityRecord
The _"university"_ Document is encoded to a native struct named _UniversityRecord_ -- as shown in <<ex-university-rec>>

[#ex-university-rec]
.The encoding of a UniversityRecord to a native structure
[source,{tutorial-platform}, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
include::example$UserProfileDemo/model/UniversityRecord.swift[indent=0, tags=universityrecord]
----

== Backend Installation


We will install <<Couchbase Server>> and <<lbl-sync-gateway>> using Docker.

=== Prerequisites
* You must have Docker installed on your laptop.
For more on Docker -- see: {docker-download--url}
* On Windows, you may need admin privileges.
* Ensure that you have sufficient memory and cores allocated to docker.
At Least 3GB of RAM is recommended.

=== Docker Network
Create a docker network named “workshop”

[source, bash, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
docker network ls

docker network create -d bridge workshop
----

=== Couchbase Server

==== Install
We have a custom docker image `priyacouch/couchbase-server-userprofile:7.0.0-dev` of Couchbase Server, which creates an empty bucket named “userprofile” and an RBAC user “admin” with “sync gateway” role.

Alternatively, you can follow the instructions in our documentation -- see: {prepare--xref}, to install Couchbase Server and configure it with the relevant bucket.

. Optionally, remove any existing Docker container
+
[source, bash, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
docker stop cb-server && docker rm cb-server
----

. Start Couchbase Server in a Docker container
+
[source, bash, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
docker run -d --name cb-server \
--network workshop \
-p 8091-8094:8091-8094 -p 11210:11210 \
priyacouch/couchbase-server-userprofile:7.0.0-dev

----

==== Test Server Install
The server could take a few minutes to deploy and fully initialize; so be patient.

. Check the Docker logs using the command:
+
[source, bash, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
docker logs -f cb-server
----
+
When the setup is completed, you should see output similar to that shown in <<ex-server-setup-output>>.
+
[#ex-server-setup-output]
.Server set-up output
image::log-output.png[]

. Now check the required data is in place:

.. Open up http://localhost:8091[http://localhost:8091^] in a browser
.. Sign in as “Administrator” and “password” in login page

.. Go to “buckets” menu and confirm “userprofile” bucket is created
+
image::confirm-bucket-created.png[]

.. Go to “security” menu and confirm “admin” user is created
+
image::confirm-admin-user-created.png[]

[#lbl-sync-gateway]
=== Sync Gateway
Now we will install, configure and run Sync Gateway.

[#lbl-install]
==== Configuration
When using Sync Gateway {target-version}, we can opt to provide a bootstrap configuration -- see: {sync-gateway-config-overview--xref}.
We would then provision database, sync and other configuration using the Admin REST endpoints
Alternatively, we can continue to run in legacy-mode, using the Pre-{target-version} configuration.

In this tutorial -- for the purposes of backward compatibility -- we will run 3.x using its
{sync-gateway-config-legacy--xref}.
That is, we will be running with the `disable_persistent_config` option in the configuration file set to `true`.
You can, if you wish, run a 2.8 version of Sync Gateway instead.

The configuration files corresponding to this sample application are shown in <<tbl-config-files>>.
They are available in the "sync" branch of the GitHub repo hosting the app, which you cloned -- look in: +
`/path/to/cloned/repo/userprofile-couchbase-mobile/content/modules/userprofile-sync/examples/` +
{empty}

.Available configuration files

[#tbl-config-files,cols="^1a,4a"]
!===
h| Release
h| Filename
| 3.x
| {config-file-3x0-legacy--url}

| 2.x
| {config-file-2x8--url}

!===

[#lbl-deploy]
==== Deploy
Let us configure and launch Sync Gateway in a Docker container.

. Switch to the folder containing the cloned configuration files, using:
+
[source, bash, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
cd /path/to/cloned/repo/userprofile-couchbase-mobile/content/modules/userprofile-sync/examples
----

. Make sure no Sync Gateway container exists, using:
+
[source, bash, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----

docker stop sync-gateway && docker rm sync-gateway

----

. Launch Sync Gateway in a Docker container
+
You should see configuration files for the latest major version and the previous major version in this folder -- see: <<tbl-config-files>>.
Choose an appropriate version.

==== Test the Installation

Now we can confirm that the Sync Gateway is up and running.

. Check the log messages
+
[source, bash, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
docker logs -f sync-gateway
----
+
You will see a series of log messages.
Make sure there are no errors.

. Then open up http://localhost:4984[http://localhost:4984^] in browser. +
You should see equivalent of the following message
+
[source, bash, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
{"couchdb":"Welcome","vendor":{"name":"Couchbase Sync Gateway","version":"{target-version}"},"version":"Couchbase Sync Gateway/{target-version-full}(145;e3f46be) EE"}
----

Now that we have the server and the sync gateway installed, we can verify data sync between Couchbase Lite enabled apps.


[#lbl-sync-function]
== Sync Function


A key component of the sync process is the Sync Function; we will first look at how that can be set-up to control how data sync works.

The Sync Function is a Javascript-function that is specified as part of the Sync Gateway Configuration
It handles <<lbl-auth>> , <<lbl-valid>>, <<lbl-route>> and <<lbl-access>>.

To get started learning about this function:

. Open your configuration file using a text editor of your choice.
It will be located in the app bundle at +
`/path/to/cloned/repo/UserProfileDemo/content/modules/userprofile/examples`.
. Locate the `sync` setting in the file

Now you can follow along with the rest of the sections below.


[#lbl-auth, reftext=Authorization]
=== Authorization
We use _Basic Authentication_ in our application.
The id of the user making the request is specified in the `Authorization` header.

Locate the `// Authorization` section of the Sync Function.
You will see that we are using the Sync function's {sync-function-api-require-user--xref} API to verify that the `email` property specified in the Document matches the id of the user making the request -- see <<ex-auth>>.

[#ex-auth]
.Sync function -- Authorization
[source, JavaScript]
----
function sync(doc, oldDoc) {

include::example${config-filename}-3-x-legacy.json[tags="authorization", indent=0]

}
----


[#lbl-valid, reftext="Data Validation"]
=== Data Validation
In the sync function we also do some basic validation of the contents of the Document -- as shown in <<ex-validation>>.

[#ex-validation]
.Sync function -- Data Validation
[source,javascript, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
include::example${config-filename}-3-x-legacy.json[tags="data-validation", indent=0]
----
<.> Verify that the `email` property is not null.
If it's null, we throw a JS exception (see `validateNotEmpty()` function)
<.> If this a new document, then verify that the `Id` of the Document is of the required format (i.e. _"user::{emailId}"_).
We throw an exception if that's not the case.
<.> If this is a document update, then verify that the `email` property value has not changed.
Again, we throw an exception if that's not the case.


NOTE: You can learn more about the Sync Function in the documentation here: {sync-function--xref}

[#lbl-route, reftext="Data Routing"]
=== Data Routing
{channels--xref} provide a mechanism to "tag" documents.
They are typically used to route/segregate documents based on the contents of those documents -- as shown in: <<ex-routing>>.

When combined with the {sync-function-api-access--xref} and {sync-function-api-require-access--xref} API, the {sync-function-api-channel--xref} API
 can also be used to enforce <<lbl-access>>.

As we shall see in a later section, clients can use channels to pull just a subset of documents.

[#ex-routing]
.Using channel() to tag/route documents
[source,javascript]
----
include::example${config-filename}-3-x-legacy.json[tags="routing", indent=0]
----
<.> Retrieve the `email` property specified in the document.
We will use this as our user and channel name
<.> Here we generate the channel name from the email property.
<.> Here we route the document to the channel.
The channel comes into existence the first time a document is added to it.

[#lbl-access, reftext="Access Control"]
=== Access Control
We can enforce access control to channels using the {sync-function-api-access--xref} API.
The approach shown in <<ex-access>> ensures that only users with access to a specific channel are able to retrieve documents in the channel.

[#ex-access]
.Controlling access to documents using channel() and access() API
[source,javascript]
----
include::example${config-filename}-3-x-legacy.json[tags="access-control", indent=0]
----
<.> Here we use the email property retrieved in <<ex-routing>> as the `username` and specify the channel the user is allowed to access

== Starting Replication

Two-way Replication between the app and the Sync Gateway is enabled when the user logs into the app.

To see the code behind this, open the project's *`DatabaseManager.swift`* file and locate the `startPushAndPullReplicationForCurrentUser()` function -- as shown in: <<ex-pushpull>>.

[#ex-pushpull]
.The startPushAndPullReplicationForCurrentUser function
[source,{tutorial-platform}, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
include::example$UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[indent=0, tags=startPushAndPullReplicationForCurrentUser]
----

In the function you will see we create an instance of the `ReplicatorConfig`, which specifies the source and target database -- see: <<ex-repl-config>>.
You could also use this to, optionally, override the default configuration settings.

[#ex-repl-config]
.Creating the replicator configuration instance
[source,{tutorial-platform}, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
include::example$UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[indent=0, tags=replicationconfig]
----
<.> Initialize with `source` as the local Couchbase Lite database and the `remote` target as the Sync Gateway

<.> Replication `type` of `pushAndPull` indicates that we require two-way sync.
A value of `.pull` specifies that we only pull data from the Sync Gateway.
A value of `.push` specifies that we only push data.

<.> The `continuous` mode is specified to be _true_ which means that changes are synced in real-time. A value of _false_  which implies that data is only pulled from the Sync Gateway.

<.> This is where you specify the authentication credentials of the user.
In the <<lbl-auth>> section, we discussed that the Sync Gateway can enforce authorization check using the `requireUser` API.

<.> The `channels` are used to specify the channels to pull from.
Only documents belonging to the specified channels are synced.
This is subject to <<lbl-access>> rights enforced at the Sync Gateway.
This means that if a client does not have access to documents in a channel, the documents will not be synced even if the client specifies it in the replicator configuration.

Now we initialize the `Replicator` with the `ReplicatorConfiguration` -- as shown in <<ex-init-repl>>

[#ex-init-repl]
.Initialize a replicator with our configuration details
[source,{tutorial-platform}]
----
include::example$UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[indent=0, tags=replicationinit]
----

In order to follow the replicator's progress, we can attach a callback listener to it.

Attaching a callback listener to the `Replicator` means we will be asynchronously notified of state changes.
This could be useful for instance, to inform the user of the progress of the replication.
It is an optional step and is shown here in <<ex-callback>>.

[#ex-callback]
.Attaching a callback listener
[source,{tutorial-platform}, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
include::example$UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[indent=0, tags=replicationlistener]
----

Now, with all that done, we can start the replicator -- see: <<ex-start>>.

[#ex-start]
.Starting a configured replicator
[source,{tutorial-platform}, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
include::example$UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[indent=0, tags=replicationstart]
----

== Stopping Replication

When user logs out of the app, the replication is stopped before the database is closed.

. Open the *`DatabaseManager.swift`* file and locate the `stopAllReplicationForCurrentUser()` function.
+
[source,{tutorial-platform}, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
include::example$UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[indent=0, tags=stopAllReplicationForCurrentUser]
----
+
. Stop the replicator and remove any associated change listeners
+
[source,{tutorial-platform}, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
include::example$UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[indent=0, tags=replicationstop]
----

TIP: When you close a database, any active replicators, listeners and-or live queries are also be closed.

[#lbl-query-events]
== Query Events / Live Queries

Couchbase Lite applications can set up _live queries_ in order to be asynchronously notified of changes to the database that affect the results of the query.
This can be very useful, for instance, in keeping a UI View up-to-date with the results of a query.

In our app, the user profile view is kept up-to-date using a live query that fetches the user profile data used to populate the view.
This means that, if the replicator pulls down changes to the user profile, they are automatically reflected in the view.

To see this:

. Open the *`UserPresenter.swift`* file and locate the `fetchRecordForCurrentUserWithLiveModeEnabled()` function.
Calling this function with a value of `true` implies that the caller wishes to be notified of any changes to query results.
+
[source,{tutorial-platform}, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
include::example$UserProfileDemo/presenter/UserPresenter.swift[indent=0, tags=fetchRecordForCurrentUserWithLiveModeEnabled]
----
+

.Defining a query using QueryBuilder
[source,{tutorial-platform}, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
include::example$UserProfileDemo/presenter/UserPresenter.swift[indent=0, tags=livequerybuilder]
----

<.> We query for documents based on document id.
In our app, there should be exactly one user profile document corresponding to this id.

.Attaching a listener callback to a query
[source,{tutorial-platform}, subs="attributes+, macros+"]
----
include::example$UserProfileDemo/presenter/UserPresenter.swift[indent=0, tags=livequery]
----

<.> Attach a listener callback to the query.
Attaching a listener automatically makes it _live_ so any time there is a change in the user profile data in the underlying database, the callback would be invoked

<.> Create an instance of a _UserRecord_ -- see: <<The User Record>>.
This will be populated with the query results.

<.> The `SelectResult.all()` method is used to query all the properties of a document.
In this case, the document in the result is embedded in a dictionary where the key is the database name, which is _"userprofile"_.
So we retrieve the
https://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/{target-version-full}/couchbase-lite-swift/Classes/DictionaryObject.html[`DictionaryObject`]
at key _"userprofile"_.

<.>  We use appropriate _type getters_ to retrieve values and populate the _UserRecord_ instance

== Exercises

[#lbl-exercise-1]
=== Exercise 1
In this exercise, we will observe how changes made on one app are synced across to the other app

. Run the app side by side in two simulators
. Log into both the simulators with same userId and password. +
Use the values _"{emailId}"_ and _"password"_ for user id and password fields respectively
. On one simulator, enter values in the user's name and address fields.
. Confirm that changes show up in the app on the other simulator.
. Similarly, make changes to the app in the other simulator and confirm that the changes are synced over to the first simulator.

=== Exercise 2
In this exercise, we will observe changes made via Sync Gateway are synced over to the apps

. Make sure you complete <<lbl-exercise-1>>.
This is to ensure that you have the appropriate user profile document (with document id of "user::{emailId}") created through the app and synced over to the Sync Gateway.

. Open the command terminal and issue the following command to get the user profile document using the {rest-api-document-get--url}.
We will be using `curl` to issue the request.
If you haven't done so, please install curl as indicated in the <<Prerequisites>> section

+
[source, bash,  subs="attributes+"]
----
curl -X GET http://localhost:4984/userprofile/user::{emailId} --user {emailId} // <.>
----
<.> This GET retrieves the userprofile document with the id `user::{emailId}``

. Your response should look something like the response below.
The exact contents depends on the user profile information that you provided via your mobile app.
+
[source,bash, subs="attributes+"]
----
{
    "_attachments": { <.>
        "blob_1": {
            "content_type": "image/jpeg",
            "digest": "sha1-S8asPSgzA+F+fp8/2DdIy4K+0U8=",
            "length": 14989,
            "revpos": 2,
            "stub": true
        }
    },
    "_id": "user::{emailId}",
    "_rev": "{revision-to-update}", // <.>
    "address": "",
    "email": "{emailId}",
    "image": {
        "@type": "blob",
        "content_type": "image/jpeg",
        "digest": "sha1-S8asPSgzA+F+fp8/2DdIy4K+0U8=",
        "length": 14989
    },
    "name": "",
    "type": "user",
    "university": "British Institute in Paris, University of London"
}
----
<.> If you had updated an image via the mobile app, you should see an *"_attachments"* property.
This entry holds an array of attachments corresponding to each image blob entry added by the mobile app.
This property is added by the Sync Gateway when it processes the document. +
You can learn more about how image Blob types are mapped to attachments here in the Couchbase Lite documentation: {cbl-blobs--xref}.
<.> Record the revision id of the document.
You will need this when you update the document

. In the command terminal, issue the following command to update the user profile document via {rest-api-document-put--url}
+
We chose to update the address field via the REST API.
You can choose to update any other profile information if you like.
You will be prompted to enter the user's password when you submit the curl command.
+
[source,bash, subs="attributes+"]
----
curl --location --request PUT 'http://localhost:4984/userprofile/user::demo@example.com?rev=3-033fcbaf269d65a9247067be76d664f1111d033b' --user 'demo@example.com' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "address": "101 Main Street",
    "email": "demo@example.com",
    "image": {
        "@type": "blob",
        "content_type": "image/jpeg",
        "digest": "sha1-S8asPSgzA+F+fp8/2DdIy4K+0U8=",
        "length": 14989
    },
    "name": "",
    "type": "user",
    "university": "British Institute in Paris, University of London"
}'
----
Here, in the `PUT`, we specify the:

* user id (`user::{emailId}`)
* revision id (from the previous step `3-033fcbaf269d65a9247067be76d664f1111d033b`) to select the item we want to update


. Confirm that you get an HTTP _"201 Created"_ status code

. As soon as you update the document via the Sync Gateway REST API, confirm that the changes show up in the mobile app on the simulator.
+
image::sync_from_sgw.gif[App Sync]

// NOTE: From <<Exercise 2>> above, you observed that changes made on the Sync Gateway are propagated to the Couchbase Lite clients. However, if you tried to update the attachment / image using the link:[Attachments REST API], you would not see the image getting updated on the client side. This is a link:[known issue] in 2.0 and should be fixed in the next release.


== Handling Conflicts during Data Synchronization

Data conflicts are inevitable in an environment where you can potentially have multiple writes updating the same data concurrently.
Couchbase Mobile supports _Automated Conflict Resolution_.

You can learn more about automated conflict resolution in this blog  {blog-doc-conflicts--url}.
